# OctaviatedStudies

This was a journey through the Aspects of Sound Control
Which I have done adicted to the Idea of Octave.
The Octave plays a great rule in the Tape Recording
Experiments of my early joung. Here I could play with
a Set of Tape Recorders which Speed could been changed
in Octave Units. From this beginning I make here the
way to other Controlled Sounds. So the first Step
was to Play simple Sound Files in different Speeds
like i have done it in the erarly joung. Then I play
a Synth in which the Paramters of a Sinusidal would been
Controlled by other Function Generators. As the last Step
I have coded a Synth in which one Sound could been controled
by other Sounds. I hope you will been inspired to do work
like this. So you should beginn a own journey to do
Controlls of Sounds by other Sounds
